Using gitand github:

The first thing to do (after telling them about what a control version system is) 
is to install git locally. Is it easy to do that in windows?

The second thing to do, is to explain that exist a couple of nice and robust webtools
for facilitating the collaborative uses of a control version system. Then we sohw them 
github.

They just need to know the basic commands

git clone <url>
git add
git commit -m "Something done"
git pull <remote> <branch>  (Maybe we can mention that there are not all control version system equals)
git push <remote> <branch>
git merge

With just that commands we can ask them:

1- Generate a new repo on github
2- clone it to their local machines
3- Add the project from the day before
4- Commit and push to the remote
5- Ask them to write same new web-based feature and push it too
6- Ask them to clone someone else repo and integrate the new feature from the cloned repo to their self

Maybe we can think a couple of fixed features, no 25 but 4 or 5, and distribute this no_uniques_features 
between groups or students whose feature are not repeated
