    - open a text file
    - write "print 'hello world'"
    - Save the file as hello_world.py
    - Open a terminal and execute:
    
        python hello_world.py
 

2 - Interacting a litle bit with the program:

    - Create a new file called echo_msg.py
    - Write the following code:
    
        print "Script number 2: Human Machine Interaction"
        msg = raw_input('Please insert a msg to be printed')
        print msg

    - Same steps than before
    - Execute:
    
        python echo_msg.py


msg = raw_input('Please choose an option:\n\t 1 for hello world\n\t 2 for hola mundo\n\t')


3 - Interacting a litle bit with the program++:

    - Create a new file called selected_msg.py
    - Write the following code:
    
        print "Script number 3: Choosing a msg"
        option = raw_input('Please choose an option:\n\t 1 for hello world\n\t 2 for hola mundo\n\t')
        if option is '1':
            print "hello world"
        elif option is '2':
            print "hola mundo"
        else:
            print "Invalid option. Please try again"

    - Same steps than before
